# Full Scale Agentic Swarm

FullScaleAgenticSwarm is a project that demonstrates the ability to generate dynamic agents for diverse logic-based tasks, driven by prompts and instructions. 🚀 This framework empowers users to create specialized agents capable of handling complex workflows, such as research 📚, image vision object detection and insightful analysis 👁️, and even generating videos from the aggregated results 🎬.

## Overview

This project aims to simplify the creation and management of agent swarms.  Instead of manually coding each agent and its interactions, FullScaleAgenticSwarm allows you to define the desired behavior through natural language prompts and structured instructions.  This approach promotes rapid prototyping and experimentation, making it easier to explore complex problem spaces. 💡

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Agent Generation:** Create agents on-the-fly based on specific tasks and requirements defined by prompts and instructions. ✨
* **Versatile Application:**  Supports a wide range of tasks, including:
    * **Research:** Automate literature reviews, data collection, and analysis. 🧐
    * **Imagery Vision:** Perform object detection, image classification, and extract relevant insights. 🖼️
    * **Video Generation:** Compile results and insights into informative videos. 🎥
* **Prompt-Based Control:** Guide agent behavior using intuitive natural language prompts. 🗣️
* **Instruction-Driven Workflow:** Define complex workflows using structured instructions, ensuring coordinated agent actions. ⚙️
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle a large number of agents and complex tasks. (This can be further elaborated upon with specific details if applicable) ⬆️
* **[Optional] Customizable Agent Behaviors:** (If applicable, mention how to customize agent behaviors beyond prompts) 🛠️
* **[Optional] Modular Design:** (If applicable, mention how the project is structured and how components can be reused) 🧩

### Example code snippet for research task (Illustrative)

```python
from fullscale_agentic_swarm import AgentSwarm
swarm = AgentSwarm()
swarm.create_agent("Researcher", prompt="Find all research papers on the impact of AI on education.")
results = swarm.run()
```

### Process and analyze results
```python
# Example code snippet for video generation (Illustrative)
swarm = AgentSwarm()
swarm.create_agent("VideoGenerator", prompt="Create a video summarizing the object detection results.")
results = swarm.run() # Pass the results from the image vision task
# Save the generated video
```
